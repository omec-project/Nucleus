## Features:
Security feature framework will be added on this branch.
The changes will include the following:
1. Support Multiple Authentication Vectors.
2. Add Security Context to MME which will include all the info regarding
Security including : KSI, UL/DL Count, KASME from selected Vector, active-flag,
         Integrity Algorithm ID, Encoding Algorithm ID.
3. Update UL Count and DL Count update for all flows. Count should include sequence Number and Overflow counter.
4. Nas Decryption should be moved to the mme-app cause we will need the info
about algorithms and count.
5. Add Integrity check for incoming messages.


## Introduction:
Nucleus is a grounds up implementation of the Mobility management Entity (MME). Its design is performance optimized for high speed mobility events over the S1-MME interface, while maintaining state coherent high transaction rate interactions over the S6a interface to the HSS and the S11 interface to the Serving Gateway Control (SGWC). The design allows maximum utilization of the transaction rate allowed by the S1-MME/Non-Access Stratum (NAS) messages over SCTP, S6a DIAMETER Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) over TCP and S11 GTPV2C messages over UDP protocols.

## Build and Installation Procedure
### Update config
Update following config files

    {install_path}/Nucleus/src/mme-app/conf/mme.json
    {install_path}/Nucleus/src/s1ap/conf/s1ap.json
    {install_path}/Nucleus/src/s11/conf/s11.json
    {install_path}/Nucleus/src/s6a/conf/*.json
    update the Diameter Configuration File:
        {install_path}/Nucleus/src/s6a/conf/s6a_fd.conf

- the following values shall be defined:
   - Identity:
      - the diameter identity.
      - default value: mme.localdomain
   - Realm:
          - the diameter realm (everything past the first period of Identity)
          - default value: localdomain

  - Refer free diameter  [config link](http://www.freediameter.net/trac/wiki/Configuration)

### Build open mme components as follows:
    cd {install_path}/Nucleus
    make clean; make; make install

### Generate certificates
The "Diameter Identity" is a fully qualified domain name that is used to access the the Diameter peer. The "Diameter Host" is everything up to the first period of the "Diameter Identity". The  "Diameter Realm" is everything after the first period of the "Diameter Identity".

Execute the following command, using the "Identity" configured in        {install_path}/Nucleus/src/s6a/conf/s6a_fd.conf

    cd {install_path}/Nucleus/target/conf
    ./make_certs.sh <diameter_host> <diameter_realm>
    For Example: ./make_certs.sh mme localdomain

   ### Start MME modules
     cd {install_path}/Nucleus/target/
     ./run.sh

## Known Issues
- O3 optimization flag is disabled in s6a module Observed issues in attach procedure when -O3 optimization flag is enabled in s6a module.

## Appendix A.
Before starting Nucleus applications respective parameters should be  configured in the json files mentioned above. For each of the application individual json file can be created, or a user can create a common json file for entire MME configuration(all interfaces), and copy contents of this file in all other jsons.
	Nucleus applications are designed modularly so that with extended IPC support user can have an individual application running on separate hosts/VMs, to help in this situation separate configuration files are created for each of the MME application(s1ap-app, s6a-app, s11-app, mme-app)

### Config Parameters
- Following is a description of each section under json file.
  - [U] - Reserved/Unused. Can be skipped in the json.
